    "üìÉ >>> If you happened to find out about this in any way, you may find yourself in an unwelcome scenario. I'm only saying this since I'll be taking my own life on a coming new year, very soon perhaps (not more than 2 years from today). To be honest, I sometimes write silly things anywhere to give the impression that I'm writing to someone, but sadly, they don't even know. Because to that person, it won't matter. [I can't end it before it because I got some responsibility over my emotion, and you're right, family. Just before I go, I had to assist them a little otherwise I'll be nothing but a waste to them.",
